### Hello!
#### After many hours of improving the project it has been finished! In this file you can find description, and installation tutorial. If you want to appreciate my work you can leave a feedback on Discord (MoDrazzz#9641), or donate (https://paypal.me/pools/c/8xKLAwHGnC).
#### 
### Installation
#### To the fully operational Okęcie Airport you need the EPWA.txt file, which you can find in the same repository, where is this file. After download, drag it to the following path: Endless ATC/locations/
#### Additionally if you want to play in real world traffic density, go to game settings, next Traffic > Custom > flow and set following values:
#### Flow min: 20
#### Flow max: 25

### Project description
#### What have I made:
#### - Runways marking
#### - SIDs and STARs of EPWA and EPMO airport
#### - TMA classes: A, B and C
#### - Possibility to direct to each STAR's waypoint
#### - Real active runways configurations
#### - Real holding courses at entry points
#### - Airport operators
#### - Much more

#### Currently acitve runway avail configurations are:
#### EPWA - 29/33, EPMO - 08
#### EPWA - 29/33, EPMO - 26
#### EPWA - 11/15, EPMO - 08
#### EPWA - 11/15, EPMO - 26
#### SIDs and STARs are fitted to active runways, as in real life.

### In plans
#### - Complete TMA classes (D, E, F, H)
#### - Correction of issues that may arise during tests
#### - Have fun :p

### What I won't do
#### I know, that there aren't made STARs for runways 15 and 29, and SIDs for runways 33 and 11 too, but these are so rarely configurations, that there isn't sense to make them, due to it's a lot of work. If you want, you can make it on your own :)

#### If possible, please give me the aforementioned feedback!

### Have fun,
